## Introduction

The project aims to develop a personal-assistant for Linux-based systems. Jarvis draws its inspiration from virtual assistants like Cortana for Windows, and Siri for iOS. It has been designed to provide a user-friendly interface for carrying out a variety of tasks by employing certain well-defined commands. Users can interact with the assistant either through ***voice commands or using a keyboard input***.
