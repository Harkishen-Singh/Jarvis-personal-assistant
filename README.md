## What Jarvis can do?

As a personal assistant, Jarvis assists the end-user with day-to-day activities like *general human conversation, searching queries in google, bing or yahoo, searching for videos, retrieving images, live weather conditions, word meanings, searching for medicine details, health recommendations based on symptoms and reminding the user about the scheduled events and tasks*. The user statements/commands are analysed with the help of **machine learning** to give an optimal solution.
